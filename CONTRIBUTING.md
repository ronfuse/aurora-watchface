# Contributing to Aurora Watch Face

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Aurora Watch Face project! We welcome contributions from the community.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features
- Provide detailed information about your device model and firmware version
- Include screenshots if possible
- Describe steps to reproduce any bugs

### Code Contributions
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test thoroughly** on simulator and real device
5. **Submit a pull request**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

1. Follow the setup instructions in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)
2. Install the recommended VS Code extensions
3. Test your changes in the Connect IQ simulator
4. Verify compatibility with multiple device types

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Monkey C Best Practices
- Use descriptive variable names with Hungarian notation where appropriate
- Add comments for complex algorithms (especially animations)
- Follow Garmin's performance guidelines for watch faces
- Use `using` statements for imports
- Declare types explicitly: `function myFunction(param as String) as Number`

### Performance Considerations
- Always consider battery impact of changes
- Use partial updates when possible
- Minimize memory allocations in drawing loops
- Test animations at different frame rates
- Implement proper sleep/wake state handling

### Animation Guidelines
- Base animations on `_animationPhase` counter
- Provide options to disable animations for battery saving
- Use trigonometric functions for smooth motion
- Keep animation calculations efficient

## üé® Design Guidelines

### Color Schemes
- Maintain consistency with existing time-based themes
- Ensure good contrast for readability
- Test colors on different screen types (MIP, AMOLED)
- Consider color-blind accessibility

### UI Elements
- Keep complication icons simple and recognizable
- Maintain visual hierarchy (time should be most prominent)
- Ensure elements are sized appropriately for small screens
- Test layouts on different screen sizes
