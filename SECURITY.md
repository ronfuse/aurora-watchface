## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations for Watch Faces

While watch faces have limited security attack surface, we consider:

### Data Privacy
- No personal data is transmitted to external servers
- Weather data uses Garmin's secure APIs only
- No user tracking or analytics

### Device Security
- Minimal memory usage to prevent device instability
- Proper error handling to prevent crashes
- No network requests outside Garmin's ecosystem

### Code Integrity
- All releases are signed with developer key
- Source code is publicly available for audit
- Dependencies are minimal and well-vetted

## üîê Best Practices for Users

### Installation
- Only install from official Garmin Connect IQ store
- Verify developer signature matches "ronfuse"
- Keep your Garmin device firmware updated

### Permissions
Aurora Watch Face requires these permissions:
- **Weather**: For current conditions display
- **UserProfile**: For activity data (heart rate, steps)
- **Positioning**: For weather location services
- **Communications**: For weather data updates

All permissions are used only for their intended purpose.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

### Secure Development
